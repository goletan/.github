# Welcome to Goletan üåê

Our goal is to provide a highly scalable, flexible, and secure environment for developers and businesses to build modern, language-agnostic, distributed applications.

‚òÑÔ∏è What is Goletan?

Goletan is a forward-thinking framework that simplifies the creation and management of distributed systems. By breaking down complex software into smaller, independent services (called Nemetons), Goletan makes your applications more maintainable, scalable, and secure.

Each Nemeton handles a specific domain or function, allowing developers to focus on one responsibility at a time. This results in a modular system where different parts can be scaled, updated, or replaced independently, increasing flexibility and adaptability.

Goletan is built to provide:

- Seamless integration with modern infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker, etc.)
- Multi-protocol support for communication (REST, GraphQL, Kafka, gRPC)
- Security-first design, with built-in mTLS/TLS and authentication
- Resilience and observability baked into every Nemeton for reliable, monitored execution
- Low-level extensibility through a powerful WASM plugin system, allowing for infrastructure-level customization

By offering this rich set of features, Goletan empowers developers to create distributed applications easily, whether you're starting fresh, migrating legacy systems, or scaling existing microservices architectures.

## üå¨ Goletan Kernel

At the heart of Goletan is the Kernel ‚Äì a powerful engine responsible for orchestrating the entire system. It ensures that all services (Nemetons) are connected, secure, and running efficiently.

The Goletan Kernel handles:

- Managing communication protocols
- Ensuring secure connections via mTLS/TLS
- Enabling resilient and observable service execution
- Supporting low-level customization through WASM plugins

## ‚ú® Nemetons

Nemetons are the building blocks of Goletan. They represent the individual services that handle specific domains like authentication, user management, logging, and more. Each Nemeton can be scaled and updated independently, allowing for flexibility and adaptability.
